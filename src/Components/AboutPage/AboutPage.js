            Technology has been a subject of interest for me since my childhood
            (Must have been all those video games). So at a very early age I had
            decided that I wanted to pursure a career developing these
            technologies . As a result I went on to get a Diploma &amp;
            Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. After completing my
            Bachelor's Degree I decided to get some practical experience and
            decided to get a job.

            After completing my Bachelor's degree I joined Maq Software as a
            Junior S\W Developer. At MAQ software I had a chance to work under
            great mentors and gained a lot of industry knowledge. The learning
            curve was very steep being a fresher but given software development
            is one of my biggest passions, I was quickly able to overcome the
            challenges and became an integral part of the project teams. My
            project managers on multiple occasions had commended me for the
            same.

            After I left MAQ software I had an oppurtunity to work as a project
            manager for Devomark. Given my previous experience as a software
            engineer it was quite challenging to lead entire project teams, plan
            project architecture, achieve milestone and deliver on time as well.
            But with perseverance and hard work I was able to rise up to the
            challenge and was often praised by the organizationâ€™s upper
            management for the same.

            Working at Profero Techno has greatly improved my communication
            skills as a project manager due to constant interaction with
            clients. This has helped me understand and bridge the gap between
            the client's expectations and the technological barrier in
            implementing them greatly. Being a project manager at a company with
            such a large product suite is very challenging at times and has
            greatly pushed my mental as well and physical capabilities. But it
            has been a great learning experience so far.
